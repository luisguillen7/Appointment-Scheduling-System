# Appointment-Scheduling-System
App that allows to create, update and delete customers and appointments.

App GUI built with SceneBuilder and written in Java. This app allows the user to create, update and delete customer and appointments. 

User must sign in through the log-in form, upon a successfully login, the user will be alerted if an appointment is scheduled within 15 minutes or not. 
Log-in form can be translated to french if the user's default system language is french.

When a customer or an appointment is created, the data is stored in a database (MySQL) and is retained.
The app pulls data from the database and displays all the customers and appointments on a GUI table for the user to see. 
Upon updating or deleting a customer or appointment on the GUI, the effects will also take place in the database since it correlates with the app (JAVA).
